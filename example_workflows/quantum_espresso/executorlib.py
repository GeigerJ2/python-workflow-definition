# # executorlib
#
# This notebook builds the Quantum Espresso energy-volume-curve workflow with [`executorlib`](https://github.com/pyiron/executorlib), a lightweight `concurrent.futures`-style executor. Tasks are submitted individually with `.submit()`, and the resulting graph is exported as a PWD `workflow.json` as a side effect. The second half of the notebook loads that same JSON with `aiida-core`, `jobflow` and `pyiron_base`/`pyiron_workflow`.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Define workflow with executorlib
#
# `SingleNodeExecutor` runs submitted functions in local worker processes. Passing `export_workflow_filename` makes it record every `.submit()` call and its dependencies and write them out as `workflow_json_filename` once the `with` block exits - no separate `write_workflow_json` call is needed, unlike the other engines.

# %%
import numpy as np
from executorlib import SingleNodeExecutor, get_item_from_future

# %%
from workflow import calculate_qe, generate_structures, get_bulk_structure, plot_energy_volume_curve

# %%
workflow_json_filename = "executorlib_qe.json"

pseudopotentials = {"Al": "Al.pbe-n-kjpaw_psl.1.0.0.UPF"}

# %% [markdown]
# Each `exe.submit()` call schedules one function call and returns a `Future`. Since `calculate_qe` returns a dict, `get_item_from_future` extracts a single key (e.g. `"structure"`, `"energy"`, `"volume"`) from a future's eventual result so it can be passed as an argument to the next `submit()` call. The relaxed structure is strained into `number_of_strains` (5) structures by `generate_structures`, and each strained structure is submitted as its own independent `scf` `calculate_qe` call - the fan-out that produces the 5 points of the energy-volume curve.

# ## Load Workflow with aiida
#
# `load_workflow_json` reconstructs the graph as an `aiida-core` `GraphHandle`. To demonstrate that the loaded graph can still be edited like one built natively with `aiida-core`, the lattice constant `a` is overridden (4.04 -> 4.05) before running it with `run_get_node`.

# %%
import json

from aiida import load_profile

from aiida.engine.launch import run_get_node

load_profile()

# %%
from python_workflow_definition.aiida import load_workflow_json

# %%
graph = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)

# %%
with open(workflow_json_filename) as _f:
    inputs = {n["name"]: n["value"] for n in json.load(_f)["nodes"] if n["type"] == "input"}
inputs['a'] = 4.05
outputs, _ = run_get_node(graph, **inputs)
{k: v.value for k, v in outputs.items()}

# %% [markdown]
# ## Load Workflow with jobflow
#
# The same JSON is loaded as a `jobflow` `Flow` and executed locally with `run_locally`, again after overriding the lattice constant `a`.

# %%
from python_workflow_definition.jobflow import load_workflow_json

# %%
from jobflow.managers.local import run_locally

# %%
flow = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)

# ## Load Workflow with pyiron_base
#
# `pyiron_base`'s loader turns the graph into a list of delayed jobs. `.draw()` visualizes the dependency graph and `.pull()` executes the whole chain (relax + 5 strained SCF calculations), after the lattice constant override.

# %%
from python_workflow_definition.pyiron_base import load_workflow_json

# %%
delayed_object_lst = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)
delayed_object_lst[-1].draw()

# %%
delayed_object_lst[0].input['a'] = 4.05

# %%
delayed_object_lst[-1].pull()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Load Workflow with pyiron_workflow
#
# Finally, the graph is loaded into a `pyiron_workflow` `Workflow`, its lattice constant overridden, drawn with `.draw()`, and executed with `run_get_node`.

# %%
from python_workflow_definition.pyiron_workflow import load_workflow_json

# %%
wf = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)

# %%
wf.get_bulk_structure.inputs.a.value = 4.05

wf.draw(size=(10,10))
