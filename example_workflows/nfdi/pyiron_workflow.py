# This notebook defines the NFDI4Ing file-based workflow benchmark with [`pyiron_workflow`](https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron_workflow) and then loads the resulting `workflow.json` into `aiida`, `jobflow` and `pyiron_base`. Every stage of the pipeline shells out to an external command-line tool (`gmsh`, `meshio`, a FEniCS-based Poisson solver, ParaView's `pvbatch`, `tectonic`) in its own conda environment and passes file paths between stages rather than in-memory Python objects — see [`workflow.py`](workflow.py).

# ## Define workflow with pyiron_workflow
#
# `to_function_node` wraps each plain Python function into a `pyiron_workflow` node; the three arguments are the node's registered class name, the function itself, and the name of its (single, unlabeled) output. Nodes are assembled into a graph by assigning them as attributes of a `Workflow` object (`wf.<name> = node(...)`), and dictionary outputs such as `convert_to_xdmf`'s are indexed with `wf.meshio_output_dict["xdmf_file"]` when wiring the next node's input.

# The assignments below build the six-stage pipeline as attributes of `wf`: mesh generation, XDMF conversion, the Poisson solve, line-plot postprocessing, LaTeX macro substitution and paper compilation. Each stage runs an external tool in its own conda environment (see `source/envs/`), so the values connecting them are file paths on disk rather than shared Python objects.

# `wf.draw()` renders the assembled node graph; `wf.graph_as_dict` is then handed to `write_workflow_json`, which serializes it into the PWD `workflow.json` format for the other engines to load.

# ## Load Workflow with aiida
#
# `load_workflow_json` rebuilds the pipeline as an `aiida-core` `GraphHandle` from `pyiron_workflow_nfdi.json`, after connecting to a local AiiDA profile with `load_profile()`. `run_get_node` re-executes the whole pipeline under `aiida`.

# %%
with open(workflow_json_filename) as _f:
    inputs = {n["name"]: n["value"] for n in json.load(_f)["nodes"] if n["type"] == "input"}
outputs, _ = run_get_node(graph, **inputs)
{k: v.value for k, v in outputs.items()}

# %% [markdown]
# ## Load Workflow with jobflow
#
# The same JSON is reconstructed as a jobflow `Flow` and executed locally with `run_locally`, independently of the `pyiron_workflow` objects used to define it.

# %%
from python_workflow_definition.jobflow import load_workflow_json

# %%
from jobflow.managers.local import run_locally

# %%
flow = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)

# %%
result = run_locally(flow)

# ## Load Workflow with pyiron_base
#
# Finally, the graph is loaded into a list of delayed `pyiron_base` jobs. `.draw()` visualizes the dependency chain and `.pull()` triggers execution, returning the final `paper.pdf` path.

# %%
from python_workflow_definition.pyiron_base import load_workflow_json

# %%
delayed_object_lst = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)
delayed_object_lst[-1].draw()
