# This notebook defines the NFDI4Ing file-based workflow benchmark with [`pyiron_base`](https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron_base) and then loads the resulting `workflow.json` into `aiida`, `jobflow` and `pyiron_workflow`. Every stage of the pipeline shells out to an external command-line tool (`gmsh`, `meshio`, a FEniCS-based Poisson solver, ParaView's `pvbatch`, `tectonic`) in its own conda environment and passes file paths between stages rather than in-memory Python objects — see [`workflow.py`](workflow.py).

# ## Define workflow with pyiron_base
#
# The `job` decorator turns a plain Python function into a delayed pyiron job. Since `convert_to_xdmf` and `poisson` return a `dict`, they are decorated with `output_key_lst=[...]` so each dictionary key becomes a separately addressable output (e.g. `meshio_output_dict.output.xdmf_file`) that can be wired into the next job's input.

from workflow import (
    generate_mesh as _generate_mesh, 
    convert_to_xdmf as _convert_to_xdmf,

    substitute_macros as _substitute_macros,
    compile_paper as _compile_paper,

# The calls below chain the six jobs together: mesh generation, XDMF conversion, the Poisson solve, line-plot postprocessing, LaTeX macro substitution and paper compilation. Since each stage runs an external tool in its own conda environment (see `source/envs/`), what is actually passed between jobs are file paths, not in-memory Python values.

# Because pyiron builds a delayed call graph rather than an explicit `Flow`/`GraphHandle` object, `write_workflow_json` only needs the final delayed object (`paper_output`) — it walks the graph backwards to discover every upstream job.

# ## Load Workflow with aiida
#
# `load_workflow_json` rebuilds the pipeline as an `aiida-core` `GraphHandle` from `pyiron_base_nfdi.json`, after connecting to a local AiiDA profile with `load_profile()`. `run_get_node` re-executes the whole pipeline under `aiida`.

# %%
import json

from aiida import load_profile

from aiida.engine.launch import run_get_node

from python_workflow_definition.aiida import load_workflow_json

# %%
graph = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)

# %%
with open(workflow_json_filename) as _f:
    inputs = {n["name"]: n["value"] for n in json.load(_f)["nodes"] if n["type"] == "input"}
outputs, _ = run_get_node(graph, **inputs)
{k: v.value for k, v in outputs.items()}

# %% [markdown]
# ## Load Workflow with jobflow
#
# The same JSON is reconstructed as a jobflow `Flow` and executed locally with `run_locally`, independently of the `pyiron_base` objects used to define it.

# %%
from python_workflow_definition.jobflow import load_workflow_json

# %%
from jobflow.managers.local import run_locally

# %%
flow = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)

# %%
result = run_locally(flow)
result

# %% [markdown]
# ## Load Workflow with pyiron_workflow
#
# Finally, the graph is loaded into a `pyiron_workflow` `Workflow`. `.draw()` shows the node graph and `.run()` executes it end to end.

# %%
from python_workflow_definition.pyiron_workflow import load_workflow_json

# %%
wf = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)

# %%
wf.draw(size=(10,10))

wf.run()
