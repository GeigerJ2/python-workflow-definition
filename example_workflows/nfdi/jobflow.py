# This notebook defines the NFDI4Ing file-based workflow benchmark with [`jobflow`](https://github.com/materialsproject/jobflow) and then loads the resulting `workflow.json` into `aiida`, `pyiron_base` and `pyiron_workflow`. Every stage of the pipeline shells out to an external command-line tool (`gmsh`, `meshio`, a FEniCS-based Poisson solver, ParaView's `pvbatch`, `tectonic`) in its own conda environment and passes file paths between stages rather than in-memory Python objects — see [`workflow.py`](workflow.py).

# ## Define workflow with jobflow
#
# The `job` decorator turns each of the six pipeline functions into a jobflow `Job` that delays execution until the `Flow` is run. Because `convert_to_xdmf` and `poisson` return a `dict`, their outputs are accessed downstream as `<job>.output.<key>` (e.g. `meshio_output_dict.output.xdmf_file`) to wire a single dictionary entry into the next job's input.

# With `source_directory` and `domain_size` fixed, the calls below chain the six jobs together: mesh generation, XDMF conversion, the Poisson solve, line-plot postprocessing, LaTeX macro substitution and paper compilation. Each job runs in its own subdirectory and conda environment (see `source/envs/`), so what actually flows from one job to the next are file paths, not in-memory results.

# ## Load Workflow with aiida
#
# `load_workflow_json` rebuilds the pipeline as an `aiida-core` `GraphHandle` from `jobflow_nfdi.json`, after connecting to a local AiiDA profile with `load_profile()`. `run_get_node` re-executes the whole pipeline under `aiida`.

# %%
with open(workflow_json_filename) as _f:
    inputs = {n["name"]: n["value"] for n in json.load(_f)["nodes"] if n["type"] == "input"}
outputs, _ = run_get_node(graph, **inputs)
{k: v.value for k, v in outputs.items()}

# %% [markdown]
# ## Load Workflow with pyiron_base
#
# The same JSON is loaded into a list of delayed pyiron jobs; `.draw()` visualizes their dependencies and `.pull()` triggers execution, returning the final `paper.pdf` path.

# %%
from python_workflow_definition.pyiron_base import load_workflow_json

# %%
delayed_object_lst = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)
delayed_object_lst[-1].draw()

# %%
delayed_object_lst[-1].pull()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Load Workflow with pyiron_workflow
#
# Finally, the graph is loaded into a `pyiron_workflow` `Workflow`. `.draw()` shows the node graph and `.run()` executes it end to end.

# %%
from python_workflow_definition.pyiron_workflow import load_workflow_json

# %%
wf = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)

# %%
wf.draw(size=(10,10))
