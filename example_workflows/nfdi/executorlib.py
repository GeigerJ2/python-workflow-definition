# This notebook defines the NFDI4Ing file-based workflow benchmark with [`executorlib`](https://github.com/pyiron/executorlib) and then loads the resulting `workflow.json` into `aiida`, `jobflow`, `pyiron_base` and `pyiron_workflow`. Every stage of the pipeline shells out to an external command-line tool (`gmsh`, `meshio`, a FEniCS-based Poisson solver, ParaView's `pvbatch`, `tectonic`) in its own conda environment and passes file paths between stages rather than in-memory Python objects — see [`workflow.py`](workflow.py).

# ## Define workflow with executorlib
#
# `executorlib` provides a `concurrent.futures`-compatible `SingleNodeExecutor`: each `exe.submit(func, ...)` call schedules a function call and immediately returns a `Future`. Since `convert_to_xdmf` and `poisson` return a `dict`, `get_item_from_future` is used to pick a single key (e.g. `"xdmf_file"`) out of a future's eventual result before passing it on as an input to the next stage.

# %%
import os

# %%
from workflow import generate_mesh, convert_to_xdmf, poisson, plot_over_line, substitute_macros, compile_paper 

# %%
from executorlib import SingleNodeExecutor, get_item_from_future

# %%
domain_size = 2.0

# %%
source_directory = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.curdir, "source"))

# %%
workflow_json_filename = "executorlib_nfdi.json"

# %% [markdown]
# Passing `export_workflow_filename` to `SingleNodeExecutor` makes it record every `submit` call as a side effect and write them out as a PWD `workflow.json` once the `with` block exits — no separate `write_workflow_json` call is needed. The six `submit` calls below mirror the six pipeline stages: mesh generation, XDMF conversion, the Poisson solve, line-plot postprocessing, LaTeX macro substitution and paper compilation.

# ## Load Workflow with aiida
#
# The JSON produced by `executorlib` is loaded into an `aiida-core` `GraphHandle` via `load_workflow_json`, after connecting to a local AiiDA profile with `load_profile()`. `run_get_node` then re-executes the whole pipeline under `aiida`.

# %%
import json

from aiida import load_profile

from aiida.engine.launch import run_get_node

load_profile()

# %%
from python_workflow_definition.aiida import load_workflow_json

# %%
graph = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)

# %%
with open(workflow_json_filename) as _f:
    inputs = {n["name"]: n["value"] for n in json.load(_f)["nodes"] if n["type"] == "input"}
outputs, _ = run_get_node(graph, **inputs)
{k: v.value for k, v in outputs.items()}

# %% [markdown]
# ## Load Workflow with jobflow
#
# The same `workflow.json` is reconstructed as a jobflow `Flow` and executed locally with `run_locally`, independently of the `executorlib` objects used to define it.

# %%
from python_workflow_definition.jobflow import load_workflow_json

# %%
from jobflow.managers.local import run_locally

# %%
flow = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)

# %%
result = run_locally(flow)
result

# %% [markdown]
# ## Load Workflow with pyiron_base
#
# `load_workflow_json` turns the graph into a list of delayed pyiron jobs; `.draw()` visualizes the dependency chain and `.pull()` triggers execution, returning the path to the final `paper.pdf`.

# %%
from python_workflow_definition.pyiron_base import load_workflow_json

# %%
delayed_object_lst = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)
delayed_object_lst[-1].draw()

# %%
delayed_object_lst[-1].pull()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Load Workflow with pyiron_workflow
#
# Finally, the graph is loaded into a `pyiron_workflow` `Workflow`. `.draw()` shows the node graph and `.run()` executes it end to end.

# %%
from python_workflow_definition.pyiron_workflow import load_workflow_json

# %%
wf = load_workflow_json(file_name=workflow_json_filename)

# %%
wf.draw(size=(10,10))

# %%
wf.run()
